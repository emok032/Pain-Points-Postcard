# Pain-Points-Postcard
A simple app to help instructors distill and track student pain points after class.


Project Title: Pain Points Postcard


Team Members: Orvin, Nat, Eric


Project Description: The objective of this application is to create a summary "postcard" of student pain points that address the primary questions and concerns of that day's lesson.

Sketch: During and after each class session, students will be able to submit succinct “pain-points” - summaries of the general topics with which they are struggling - and vote other students’ pain points.  After each class session, the app will then tally the votes and automatically move the top two or three pain point messages into a “postcard” that the instructors can use to tailor their lessons.  We will use a simple natural language API to categorize pain points, and the GitHub API to tie each new postcard to the current topic folder in the course’s Repo.  


APIs: Watson Alchemy (Natural Language Processing), GitHub API.
